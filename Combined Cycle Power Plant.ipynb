    "# Data Set Information \n",
    " **From the website provided:** <br> <br> The dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full load. Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the plant. <br>\n",
    " \n",
    "A combined cycle power plant (CCPP) is composed of gas turbines (GT), steam turbines (ST) and heat recovery steam generators. In a CCPP, the electricity is generated by gas and steam turbines, which are combined in one cycle, and is transferred from one turbine to another. While the Vacuum is colected from and has effect on the Steam Turbine, the other three of the ambient variables effect the GT performance. <br>\n",

    "For comparability with our baseline studies, and to allow 5x2 fold statistical tests be carried out, we provide the data shuffled five times. For each shuffling 2-fold CV is carried out and the resulting 10 measurements are used for statistical testing.\n",

    "The last part of the information was found irrelevant, thus, although the data was distributed through five different sheets, it was all joined in one single sheet (since the row entries were shuffled, it was found to be no problem to join all the entries/registers together). The goal with that is to be able to handle the dataset more easily. \n",

    "In this project, it will be studied how the hourly average ambient variables T, AP, RH and V correlate with the EP of the power plant. The dataset will thus be divided in training and test sets. Different regression algorithms will be tried out in the training datasets and trained algorithms will be tested in the test dataset using accuracy as the metric."
